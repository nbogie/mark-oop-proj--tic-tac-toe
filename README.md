## Context

You work for a game development company.

You have inherited a Tic Tac Toe project that was started during a small internal hackathon, which the company would like to polish up.

The software engineer who developed the codebase has left, so you can't ask them questions...

... but there appear to be some helpful files left under `/src`:
1. `INSTRUCTIONS.md`: a brief guide to setup and installation; and
2. `tic-tac-toe.ts`: the main code and some documentation;
3. `tic-tac-toe.spec.ts`: some written tests to accompany the code.

## Exercise 1: Newcomer Notes

Your first task is to spend some time with the codebase, forming some observations, questions and ideas about the project and how it currently works (or could/should).

**Your deliverable will be a document named `NEWCOMER_NOTES.md`**.

We expect you to picture yourself as the new project owner, and express yourself as truly as possible, so please feel free to not be shy.

You can use a succinct writing style, as long as you consider it understandable in the context of team work.

This exercise will help you take ownership of the project, and help us understand your thought process.

## Exercise 2: Backlog

The time you spend on this exercise should account for **about 75% of the timeframe** that you allocated for yourself (**~2/3 hours**).

As a second exercise, we would like you to complete at least two of the following backlog items, and commit your work.

You may use any external helper, library, or tool that you feel would benefit your work.

**Your deliverable will be commits of code and documentation in response to chosen items.**

Title | Description | Goal | Estimated difficulty
--- | --- | --- | ---
**Testing for column wins** | Our Tic Tac Toe game has a test for a row win, but it doesn't have a test written for a column wins. | Write a test to check that it detects a column win. | ⭐️
**Diagonal wins** | Our Tic Tac Toe game needs to be able to detect when any valid win happens (rows, columns and diagonals). <br /><br /> There is one test written for this, `'Detects a diagonal win'`, but it is currently being skipped - it fails when it is run. | Implement a fix so that the game detects diagonal wins and the test passes. | ⭐️
**Print board** | To play the game, users need to be able to check the current board. <br /><br /> The `.getBoard()` method returns the array representation of the board, but our players (with no coding experience) are finding it hard to understand what this means. <br /><br /> It seems that the previous maintainer left a related TODO, under `.printBoard()`, with a previous test (currently skipped). | Complete the `.printBoard()` method to pass the test, and document it in the public interface so that it's easy for others to quickly refer to and use. | ⭐️
**Status reporting** | Currently, the `.getStatus()` method returns a descriptive string. <br /><br /> A team-mate wants to use the status information, but she is finding it annoying to have to parse the string. | Rewrite `.getStatus()` so that it instead returns an object of type `{ isComplete: boolean, turnPlayer?: Marker, winner?: Marker }`, and make changes to the associated tests | ⭐️⭐️
**Handle draws** | At the moment, the game only reports 'wins' and 'ongoing' - but Tic Tac Toe often ends in a draw! | Write the tests and code to handle draws in some sensible way | ⭐️⭐️
**Remove reduce** | Currently, there are a couple of `.reduce` methods scattered throughout the code, which some junior members of your team have found it difficult to maintain or debug. | Refactor the code to replace all `.reduce` calls with imperative programming constructs | ⭐️⭐️⭐️
